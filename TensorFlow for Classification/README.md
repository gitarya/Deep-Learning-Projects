# Tensorflow Demo

Overview
============
This project helps train a classifier to recognize handwritten character images [MNIST digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It uses logistic regression as it's model and trains on a small MNIST dataset before testing the trained model on it. You can view the constructed data flow graph using Tensorboard in your browser after training.
